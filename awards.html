                        <p>BiSC - At Ritz Eco Facilities Management, we have BICSc accredited trained assessors who instruct our cleaning operatives to adhere to these high standards. We also maintain corporate BICSc membership, which you can confirm by clicking the logo on our website's home page. The top accredited cleaning companies should ideally possess BICSc accreditation - don't hesitate to ask them why they lack this if that's the case.</p>

This accreditation provides businesses seeking a cleaning company or other professional trade with the peace of mind that their supply chain is secure and resilient, allowing contractors to showcase their adherence to a range of crucial criteria, including health and safety, environmental responsibility, modern slavery prevention, diversity, equality, workplace well-being, and financial stability, all under one certification."</p>

As an affirmation of our dedication to this cause, we make certain that every assessor undergoes SSIP Assessor Training and undergo independent SSIP Auditor evaluations.
        
                        As a result, it is unsurprising that Ritz Cleaners has proudly maintained full SMAS accreditation for several years.</p>

                    <p>Since 1997, CHAS has established itself as a reliable provider of health and safety (H&S) assessments. They are at the forefront of delivering compliance and risk management services, assisting contractors, including those in commercial cleaning, as well as clients (buyers) in showcasing their adherence to their acclaimed supply chain and risk management services.
        
                        As co-founders and pioneers of the Safety Schemes in Procurement (SSIP) and the Common Assessment Standard, CHAS leads the industry by setting high compliance standards that elevate supply chain risk management practices nationwide. Our mission is clear: to enhance workplace safety for businesses, employees, and the general public.
                        
                        When in search of accredited cleaning companies, it's crucial to prioritize both SMAS and CHAS accreditations.
                        
                        Once again, Ritz Cleaners proudly holds full CHAS accreditation, a recognition we've maintained for several years.</p>
